Changes to come:

- Feedback Button
- Catch rate in Live Route
- Favorable vs Unfavorable matchup in compare tab
- Update Live Battle to match new Pokemon profile UI
- Pull level of Pokemon from OCR data to adjust Base Stats on the fly in Live Battle
- Multi-view search (compare style block)
- Compare from Live Battle should bring to compare window with it preselected, in case "replace from team builder" is wanted quick

Known Issues:

- Typing 'Mt.' without the '.' does not keyword the locations in the Area Search Tab
- Live Route occasionally loses confidence of the current area
