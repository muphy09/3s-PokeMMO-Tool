Changes to come:

- Feedback Button
- Favorable vs Unfavorable matchup in compare tab
- Pull level of Pokemon from OCR data to adjust Base Stats on the fly in Live Battle
- Multi-view search (compare style block)
- Team Builder should include EVs IVs Nature and Lv to display proper stats
    - Import this data to Compare when pulled from 'Replace from Active Team'
- Make the day/night encounters appear in the Area Search as one block like Live Route
--------------------------------------
Known Issues:

- Typing 'Mt.' without the '.' does not keyword the locations in the Area Search Tab
- Live Route occasionally loses confidence of the current area
- Mantyke evolution data
